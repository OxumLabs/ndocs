This means Neit gives you more freedom when naming your variables and functions, as long as you avoid using C's reserved keywords. Since Neit relies on translating its code into C, it's important to avoid naming your variables or functions using words that are reserved in C (like <code>int</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>return</code>). If you do, it could cause conflicts and errors during compilation. To prevent these issues, a simple rule of thumb is to modify names that sound like C keywords. You can do this by adding an underscore (<code>_</code>) to the beginning or end of your variable or function names, or by adding additional characters. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Instead of naming a function <code>return</code>, you could name it <code>return_</code> or <code>my_return</code>.</li> <li>Instead of using <code>int</code> as a variable name, you could use <code>int_value</code> or <code>my_int</code>.</li> </ul> <p>This ensures your code remains unique and doesn't clash with C's syntax.</p>"},{"location":"rules/#principles","title":"Principles","text":"<ol> <li>Code Cleanliness: To help make Neit code clean and maintainable.</li> <li>Safety Assurance: To ensure that your code remains safe and free from common pitfalls.</li> </ol> <p>By following these guidelines, you'll create code that is not only readable but also secure.</p>"},{"location":"rules/#code-cleanliness","title":"Code Cleanliness","text":"<p>Neit encourages a clean and readable code structure.
